# Inverted-Search
This project implements an Inverted Search System that efficiently indexes and retrieves data, inspired by the principles of search engines and document indexing. The system is designed with a focus on performance and simplicity, leveraging foundational programming concepts.

Key Features:
  Create Database: Generate an inverted index by extracting word-file mappings from input files.
  Display Database: View the structured index that maps words to their respective files.
  Search Functionality: Quickly locate files containing specific keywords using efficient indexing techniques.
  Save Database: Persist the current state of the inverted index to a file for reuse.
  Update Database: Dynamically modify or expand the index by adding new word-file mappings.
Technical Highlights:
  Incorporates hashing to ensure fast and efficient indexing and retrieval.
  Utilizes data structures such as linked lists to handle dynamic data efficiently.
  Demonstrates fundamental concepts of search engines and document indexing, with a practical and hands-on approach.
  This project serves as a foundation for understanding the mechanics behind search systems, emphasizing efficiency, organization, and dynamic data handling.
